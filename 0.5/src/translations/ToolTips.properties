singleFile=<html>The default mode of operation is to separate the each track<BR> into a separate file. But sometimes this is not what you want<BR> Sometimes you want the stream recorded to a single (big) file <BR> without splitting into tracks. This option does this.<BR> If you use this option without writing something in the textfield,<BR> a timestamped filename will automatically be used.</html>
maxSize=<html>Use this flag to tell StreamRipStar to rip a certain number of Megabytes, then stop.</html>
maxSizeField=maxSizeField=<html>Enter a number of Megabytes,<BR> after StreamRipStar stop ripping</html>
maxLength=<html>Tell StreamRipStar to stop ripping after a certain time.<BR>Enter in :<BR>- first field: hours: <BR>-second field: minutes<BR>- third field: seconds</html>
maxLengthHours=<html>Number of hours</html>
maxLengthMinutes=<html>Number of minutes</html>
maxLengthSeconds=<html>Number of seconds</html>
useragent=<html>In the http request, StreamRipStar includes a string that identifies<BR> what kind of program is requesting the connection.<BR>By default it is the string "Streamripper/1.x". But some Stream don't like<BR> ripping their tracks and autodisconnect your connection. With with option<BR> you can choose an different useragent like "Winamp" or "xmms"</html>
useragentField=<html>Enter here your useragent</html>
runIndex=<html>When the files are copied from incomplete to complete, the filename can be prepended<BR> with a sequence number (beginning with  0000). This can be used to, for example,<BR> show the order that the files were created. If desired, a starting<BR> count can be used with -q to begin the sequence at any number you like.</html>
runIndexField=<html>Enter here the sequence number. E.g 001</html>
pattern=<html>This option tells StreamRipStar how to form the filenames.<BR>By default the output files are put in a directory that<BR>has the same name as the stream, and files are formed from the artist and title.<BR>But you can override this behavior and create the output files as you like.<BR>The output file names are generated by substituting tokens with<BR> values that depend on the stream, track, or environment </html>
relayServer=<html>Creates a relay server on port that is specified in the field.<BR>If you have started a relay server you can get the port by<BR>clicking on the information icon on the main window</html>
relayServerField=<html>Port where your Realy Server listing on.</html>
maxConnections=<html>Specify the maximum number of connections to your Relay Server.<BR>For unlimited connections enter 0</html>
maxConnectionsField=<html>Number of Connections to your Realy Server</html>
relayConnect=<html>With this option you can automatically start your Mediaplayer with on the relay stream.<BR>If the relay stream doesn't exist,<BR>StreamRipStar will automatic connect to the internet stream<BR>E.g if you like to save bandwidth of your internet connection.</html>
proxy=<html>Use HTTP proxy server at <url></html>
proxyField=<html>Enter here url for proxy server</html>
skipTrack=<html>Sometimes the first few tracks generated by a stream are not useful,<BR>because they are advertisements, the station intro, broken songs, etc.<BR>Use this option and these tracks won't be saved.</html>
skipTrackField=<html>Number of skiped tracks at the beginning of ripping.</html>
timeout=<html>Some streams will "hang", which means they haven't disconnected,<BR>but they aren't sending any data. When this happens, and you used this option<BR>streamRipStar will shut down the stream and reconnect after the VALUE of time in the Field.</html>
timeoutField=<html>Number of seconds before StreamRipStar restarts the connection</html>
overWrite=<html>When StreamRipStar rips tracks they are put into the incomplete directory<BR>until they are finished. Normally, they are then moved into the<BR>complete directory. However, when the track is already there, can use<BR>this option to tell StreamRipStar what you want to do.
overWriteNever=<BR><BR>If you use this option, this tells StreamRipStar to never<BR>overwrite any existing file in the complete directory.</html>
overWriteAlways=<BR><BR>If you use this option, this tells StreamRipStar to always<BR>overwrite any existing file in the complete directory.</html>
overWriteLarger=<BR><BR>If you use this option, this tells StreamRipStar to overwrite<BR>an existing file in the complete directory if the newer file is larger.
overWriteVersion=<BR>><BR>IF you use this option, this tells StreamRipStar to rename the new files<BR<if the file already exitst. (for example: myFafouriteSong.mp3 -> my FafouriteSong(1).mp3
dontOverIncom=<html>Normally StreamRipStar writes the files in the incomplete directory,<BR>and then moves it to the base directory (the complete directory) when it is done.<BR>If the file with the name of the track already exists in incomplete,<BR>it will overwrite the old track.  When you use this option,this will<BR>tell StreamRipStar to backup the existing file in incomplete<BR>(appending a version number), and then create the new file.<BR>This is useful for streams that don't have meta-data. Because these<BR>streams only have a single file, reconnects will cause overwriting the<BR>existing file, which is not desired.</html>
truncate=<html>When you are not overwriting files in the complete folder,<BR>the duplicate files will normally stay in the incomplete  folder.<BR>This option tells StreamRipStar to truncate the files to zero bytes<BR>in the incomplete folder if they are a duplicate.</html>
noStreamDir=<html>Normally StreamRipStar will make a directory with the same name<BR>as the stream to place the tracks into, this disables that.</html>
dontScanPorts=<html>Disables the "scan for free port" feature. Use it if your paranoid,<BR>or don't like ports being open.</html>
dontReconnect=<html>Normally StreamRipStar will be very aggressive and try to re-connect<BR>to a dropped stream. This option disables this behavior.</html>
noID3Tag=<html>Mp3 files have two different kinds of header information which describe<BR>the contents of the file: ID3V1 and ID3V2. By default, both are<BR>included in the mp3 files generated by StreamRipStar. If you use the<BR>option, then neither are included.</html>
dCInvTracks=<html>The default mode of operation is to create one file for each track.<BR>But sometimes you don't want these files.  For example, you might<BR>prefer a single file (using the 'single file' option), or you want to use StreamRipStar<BR>as a relay Server, without creating these files.<BR>With this Option, the individual files for each track are not created.</html>
createRelayPlaylist=<html>Create a playlist including all played tracks and distributed over the realy stream</html>
createRelayPlaylistTF=<html>Enter here the path where the playlist should be saved</html>
interfaceCB=<html>If you like to rip from an specified interface, activate this checkbox</html>
interfaceTF=<html>enter here the interface (e.g. eth0, wlan0)</html>
metaDataRuleFileCB=<html>This tells streamripper to use custom meta-data parsing rules. Without<BR>this flag, streamripper will use its built-in parsing rules.<BR><BR>There are two cases where you want to do this. In the first case, you<BR>are using a stream that changes the meta data within a song. Usually<BR>this is a thank-you notice or possibly an advertisement for an upcoming<BR>show. When this happens, the current track will become split into<BR>fragments. To prevent this, you can tell streamripper to ignore<BR>meta-data.<BR><BR>The second case you might want to use this is if the artist and title<BR>information is sent in an unusual format. For example, they might be<BR>separated by a comma instead of a hyphen, or there might be an extra<BR>advertisement attached to the end of the meta-data string. In this<BR>case, you can tell streamripper how it should identify the title,<BR>artist, album and track from the metadata string using regular<BR>expressions.<BR><BR>See the file parse_rules.txt, which is included in your distribution,<BR>for examples of the parse rules.</html>
metaDataRuleFileTF=<html>Enter here the path to the meta-data parsing rules file</html>
externalCmdMetaDataCB=<html>Some streams do not send artist or title information using metadata<BR>but instead send this information using other means. For example, some<BR>streams update the current artist and title using html or xml. Another<BR>example is icecast 1.x, which sends metadata through a UDP socket.<BR><BR>Streamripper can get artist and title information from these kinds of<BR>streams using a helper application, specified using the -E option. The<BR>helper application works by finding the title and artist, and writing<BR>it to stdout. Streamripper reads the output of the helper program, and<BR>splits the tracks accordingly.<BR><BR>To help you in creating external commands to use with streamripper,<BR>please look at the example file fetch_external_metadata.pl, which is<BR>included in your distribution.</html>
externalCmdMetaDataTF=<html>Enter here the path to the extern program witch prints the<BR>Meta-Data to stdout.</html>
freeArgumentATT=<html><b>Attention: Use this option only if you really know what you are doing.<BR>If you enter wrong arguments StreamRipStar may won't work.<BR>Never use arguments <BR>--stderr<BR>--quiet</b>
freeArgumentCB=<BR><BR>Enter here arguemts for Streamripper witch are not yet supported by StreamRipStar.<BR>Usually StreamRipStar should support all options offered by streamripper.<BR> But if you use an new version of streamripper an no update for StreamRipStar<BR> came out, you may use this option to enter new free arguemts.</html>
freeArgumentTF=<BR><BR>Enter here the arguments like you would enter it on the command line version.</html>
codeset=<html>If you have problems with wrong shown characters you can change<BR>here the codeset. By default, streamripper uses the default from<BR>of your operating system.</html>
codesetTF=<html>Enter here the new codeset. Examples are:<BR>CP1252<BR>UTF-8<BR>ISO-8859-1<BR>:<BR>:<BR>ISO-8859-9<BR></html>
xs2CB=<html>Use capisce´s new algorithm (Apr 2008) for silence detection</html>
xs=<html>Streamripper automatically splits tracks based on detection<BR>of a silent near the meta interval where the track changes.<BR>However, this method is imperfect, and sometimes the track<BR>splitting occurs is too early or too late. These options will<BR>fine tune the track splitting capabilities for streams that use<BR>cross-fading, which causes streamripper´s automatic silence<BR>detection routine to fail.<BR><BR>Finetuning the splitpoint settings is a complex thing.<BR>Please consult streamrippers homepage for more information.</html>
xsTime=<html>Please enter time in<b>milli seconds</b></html>
id3tagV1CB=<html>ID3Tag includes information about the track in is<BR>included in the mp3 file. The artist and title is automatically<BR>included in the file if you activate this option.</html>
id3tagV2CB=<html>ID3Tag includes information about the track in is<BR>included in the mp3 file. The artist and title is automatically<BR>included in the file if you activate this option.<BR>ID3TagV2 is more flexible than V1.</html>
